                <strong>Call for Papers</strong>

        </h3>


   <p>The triumvirate of technologies &#8211; Internet of Things (IoT),
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the hybridlate Cloud (Cloud, Fog, Edge),
   complemented with modern software engineering practices,
   stimulates the emergence of new approaches to Science Gateways.
   Blockchain and Smart Contracts could also be instrumental in this respect as they may facilitate
   decentralised, standards and market driven aggregation of data and computing resources,
   which are needed for scientific work. These technologies may also be useful for the
   development of new Virtual Research Environments and Virtual Labs.</p>
   <p>We invite the submission of papers related to Science Gateways.
   Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
   <ul>
   <li style="list-style-type: none;">
   <ul>
   <li>Architectures, frameworks and technologies for science gateways</li>
   <li>Science gateways sustaining productive collaborative communities</li>
   <li>Support for scalability and data-driven methods in science gateways</li>
   <li>Improving the reproducibility of science in science gateways</li>
   <li>Science gateway usability, portals, workflows and tools</li>
   <li>Software engineering approaches for scientific work</li>
   <li>Aspects of science gateways, such as security and stability</li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   </ul>
   <p>We in particular encourage the submissions from application scientists and community members,
   reporting their experiences with science gateways.
   There are three forms of presentation:</p>
   <ul>
   <li style="list-style-type: none;">
   <ol>
   <li>Talks</li>
   <li>Lightning talks</li>
   <li>Demonstrations</li>
   </ol>
   </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Submission of a full paper may result in a talk, submission of an abstract may result in a lightning talk or a demonstration.
   Presenters of full papers will be given a 15-minute time slot to provide a summary and update to their work.
   Presenters of abstracts will be given a 5-minute time slot .</p>
   <p>All contributions will be subject to standard peer review on quality, relevance and novelty, which will decide acceptance and form of presentation.
   All submissions will be held in confidentiality prior to publication in the proceedings.
   <strong>Full papers must not exceed</strong> <strong>six A4 pages</strong> and must be written in clear and readable English.
   <strong>Abstracts must not exceed 500 words</strong> and may include a diagram. They should also be written in clear, readable English.
   Authors of abstracts should put the word “Abstract:” in the title.</p>
   <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Papers and abstracts will be accepted electronically in PDF format only and are to be submitted through our
   <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=iwsg2021">EasyChair website</a></span>.
   Please find templates for papers and abstracts below.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><a href="IWSG-2021-templates.zip">IWSG Paper and Abstract Templates</a></span>
