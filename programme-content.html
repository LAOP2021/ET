                            Evaluation has always been a key challenge in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) based software, due to the technical complexity of the software artifact and, often, its embedding in complex human+machine decision-making processes. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) enabled by deep neural networks has exacerbated the challenge of evaluating such software due to the opaque nature of these ML-based artifacts. A key related issue is the (in)ability of such systems to generate useful explanations of their outputs, and we argue that the explanation and evaluation problems are closely linked. The paper models the elements of a ML-based AI system in the context of applications involving both artificial and human intelligence, and maps these elements against issues in both evaluation and explanation, showing how the two are related. In particular, this talk will consider emerging applications, opportunities and challenges of AI+human collaboration in the context of science gateways.

                            Large scale simulation experimentation typically requires significant computational resources due to an excessive number of simulation runs and replications to be performed. The traditional approach to provide such computational power, both in academic research and industry/business applications, was to use computing clusters or desktop grid resources. However, such resources not only require upfront capital investment but also lack the flexibility and scalability that is required to serve a variable number of clients/users efficiently. This paper presents how SakerGrid, a commercial desktop grid based simulation platform and its associated science gateway have been extended towards a scalable cloud computing solution. The integration of SakerGrid with the MiCADO automated deployment and autoscaling framework supports the execution of multiple simulation experiments by dynamically allocating virtual machines in the cloud in order to complete the experiment by a user-defined deadline.

                            In the course of every building project, it is necessary to address a number of complex problems and issues falling under the broad categories of safety at work, construction site management, management of resources, waste and assets, construction progress monitoring and early (disaster) warning. These problems can be addressed by implementing innovative smart applications that rely on the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud-to-Edge computing, Blockchain and Smart Contracts. However, using these technologies to build smart applications is currently still a very complex process for smart site designers, such as architects. The new DECENTER Fog Computing and Brokerage Platform is designed to bridge this gap, and ease the process of smart applications development. It facilitates the development of AI Microservice-based applications, and relies on an orchestrator, and underlying probabilistic algorithms designed to achieve high Quality of Service (QoS). In this study we investigate the DECENTER’s process for smart application development, including the actual, real-world smart environment setup that includes cameras and sensors on the ground, potential actors, such as construction workers and visitors and objects, such as building equipment, waste, materials and so on, so that data and information can be collected and information, signalisation and notifications can be provided through the use of smartphones, digital signalisation and actuators.

                                The Cyberinfrastructure (CI) ecosystem consists of computing and data systems, advanced instruments, visualization environments and people. Science Gateways, also known as vir- tual labs or virtual research environments, provide user-centric solutions that ease the use of complex CI. Common to virtually all computational enabling CI components such as science gateways and scientific workflow systems is the use of physical resources (storage systems and execution environments) to manage data and execute codes (applications), yet there is no uniform way of describing either the resources or the applications. Unfortunately, interoperability across these components remains poor. Thus, CI components end up inventing their own semantics for describing them, build their own catalogs of them, and then couple the component to their proprietary descriptions. This approach leads to needlessly repetitive work on the part of CI developers and users, while simultaneously rendering the components themselves less interoperable. In this paper, we propose tackling this inter- operability problem by defining uniform semantics for describing resources and applications. After motivating the effort through a brief discussion of a number of popular CI components, we sketch a solution to the problem of a common description and catalog of resources: we describe an approach to implementing a resource registry for use by the community and discuss potential approaches to some long-term challenges. We conclude by looking ahead to the application description language, which could be tackled in earnest in a future work.</p>

                            In his talk, Nabrzyski discusses various models for supporting science through computation and technology. He starts with traditional models of research computing centers and then moves to and focuses more on more advanced models that are similar to national supercomputing centers' models. Nabrzyski will show how science gateways and related technologies advance traditional research computing support functions and will present several examples of projects where a holistic approach to supporting science adds value to researchers and minimizes time to scientific results.

                            Cloud computing offers resources on-demand and without large capital investments. As such, it is extremely attractive to many industry and scientific application areas that require large computation and storage facilities and it has become the major computing resource behind current science gateways. However, many end users are still struggling to get the full benefits from using the elastic nature of the cloud. Major factors prohibiting wider take-up and efficient utilisation of cloud technologies include limited automated elasticity/scalability of resources at the level of cloud applications, fear of potential vendor lock-in by depending on one particular cloud technology, and increased security concerns imposed by the third party provisioning model and the technology itself. This keynote presentation will provide an overview of such challenges facing end users when utilising cloud resources via science gateways. Through the examples of current and recent European research projects it will present possible solutions for the problems of automated application deployment, dynamic scalability and enhanced security.

                                Virtual research environments are systems called to serve the needs of their designated communities of practice. Every community of practice is a group of people dynamically aggregated by the willingness to collaborate to address a given research question. The development of such a typology of system thus to guarantee its uptake from the community of practice is a challenging task. In this paper, we advocate how the co-creation driven approach promoted by D4Science proven to be effective. In particular, we present the co-creation options supported, discuss how these options have been exploited by diverse communities of practice and give some usage indicators on the so created VREs.

                                In order to increase the value of scientific datasets and improve research outcomes, it is important that only trust- worthy data is used. This paper introduces mechanisms by which scientists and the organisations they represent can certify the authenticity of characteristics and provenance of published datasets so that secondary users can inspect and gain confidence in the qualities of data sources. By drawing on data models and protocols emerging to provide self-sovereign ownership of identity and personal data to individuals, we conclude that providing self-sovereignty to digital assets offers a promising approach for institutions to certify qualities of their datasets in a cryptographically secure manner, and enables secondary data users to efficiently perform verification of the authenticity of such certifications. By building upon emerging standards for decentralized identification and cryptographically verifiable credentials, we envisage an infrastructure of interoperable tools being developed to foster improvements in the quality of infor- mation provided in support of shared data assets.

                                Science gateways are widely utilised in a range of scientific disciplines to provide user-friendly access to complex distributed computing infrastructures. The traditional approach in science gateway development is to concentrate on this simplified resource access and provide scientists with a graphical user interface to conduct their experiments and visualise the results. However, as user communities behind these gateways are growing and opening their doors to less experienced scientists or even to the general public as “citizen scientists”, there is an emerging need to extend these gateways with training and learning support capabilities. This paper describes a novel approach showing how science gateways can be extended with embedded e-learning support using an ontology-based learning environment called Knowledge Repository Exchange and Learning (KREL). The paper also presents a prototype implementation of a science gateway for analysing earthquake data and demonstrates how the KREL can extend this gateway with ontology-based embedded e- learning support.
