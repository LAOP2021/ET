            <em>Due to the ongoing circumstances related to COVID-19, LAOP 2021 will take place as virtual event on ??th and ??th June, 2021, from ?pm to ?pm (MEXICO time), with a social event planned between ??pm - ??pm on ?? ??th ??.
 We plan to publish the proceedings in ??, which will lead to open-access, fully citable publications.
We will cut down the presentation time for the virtual event: accepted full papers will result in ?? min talks, accepted abstracts in 5 min talks. This way the program should fit across two half-days. </em></p>
            <p>
                The LAOP Workshop 2021 continues a series of Workshops that have been previously organized in 2010 and 2012, also in Cancun, Quintana Roo always with the financial support from CONACyT and DEGESU-SEP and the OSA sponsorship

            <p>
               The aim of the Workshop is to provide an opportunity to students and young researches to expand their optics and photonics horizons and be exposed to cutting edge research from the leaders, on a friendly environment that ease networking and further collaboration. To further encourage such liaison, there will be an important amount of time devoted to discussions along the courses and during the attendance poster session. In order to encourage a larger interaction between speakers and attendants will be lodged on the same site.

Mexico has a system of graduate internships (Becas mixtas) and also graduate studies via abroad scholarships. Previous Workshops have allowed students to do research visits, pursue Ph.D. degrees overseas, and also start collaborations. Therefore, we encourage graduate students and young researches to attend the LAOP Workshop 2021. We are doing our best effort to provide as many scholarships as possible to help students and young researchers to attend the Workshop. Detailed information for applying to a scholarship is provided in the website

            <p>The workshop aims to bring together researchers and scientists from different scientific domains, along with software engineers and Science Gateways developers, to discuss problems and solutions in the area, to identify new issues, to shape future directions for research, foster the exchange of ideas, standards and common requirements and push towards the wider adoption of Science Gateways in e-Science. High quality contributions will be invited to a Special Issue, which is traditionally organised in an SCI journal jointly with the Gateways 2020 and IWSG-A events.</p>
